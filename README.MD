# Overview

Simple script to generate a simple report of case volume.  Given a list of case locations, opens each case then reports by batch load:
- Nuix Case GUID
- Batch Load GUID
- Batch Load Date
- Total Items
- Total Audited Size Bytes
- Total File Size Bytes

Not intended to perform any complex metrics gathering, but instead be a dead simple and quick way to get a high level view of processing volume over time while not capturing sensitive data like custodian names, case names, etc.

# Getting Started

## Setup

Begin by downloading the latest release of this code.  Extract the contents of the archive into your Nuix scripts directory.  In Windows the script directory is likely going to be either of the following:

- `%appdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - User level script directory
- `%programdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - System level script directory

# Cloning this Repository

This script relies on code from [Nx](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx) to present a settings dialog and progress dialog.  This JAR file is not included in the repository (although it is included in release downloads).  If you clone this repository, you will also want to obtain a copy of Nx.jar by either:
1. Building it from [the source](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx)
2. Downloading an already built JAR file from the [Nx releases](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx/releases)

Once you have a copy of Nx.jar, make sure to include it in the same directory as the script.

This script also relies on code from [SuperUtilities](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities).  This JAR file is not included in the repository (although it is included in release downloads).  If you clone this repository, you will also want to obtain a copy of SuperUtilities.jar by either:
1. Building it from [the source](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities)
2. Downloading an already built JAR file from the [SuperUtilities releases](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities/releases)

Once you also have a copy of SuperUtilities.jar, make sure to include it in the same directory as the script.
